### Start by updating the packages list:
    sudo apt update

### Install the build-essential package by typing:
    sudo apt install build-essential
The command installs a bunch of new packages including gcc, g++ and make.

### You may also want to install the manual pages about using GNU/Linux for development:
    sudo apt-get install manpages-dev

### To validate that the GCC compiler is successfully installed, use the gcc --version command which prints the GCC version:
    gcc --version
