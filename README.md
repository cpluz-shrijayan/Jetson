Prerequisites
In order to be successful in this course, you will need the following:
Hardware
Jetson Nano Developer Kit
Computer with Internet Access and SD card port
microSD Memory Card (32GB UHS-I minimum)
compatible 5V 4A Power Supply with 2.1mm DC barrel connector
2-pin jumper
USB cable (Micro-B to Type-A)
compatible USB webcam camera such as
Logitech C270 Webcam
The complete hardware kit is available from Sparkfun either with the Jetson Nano included or without the Jetson Nano included.
Computer
A computer with an internet connection and the ability to flash your microSD card
An available USBA port on your computer (you may need an adapter if you only have USBC ports)
 
Welcome to Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano! In this course, you will build AI projects on your own NVIDIAÂ® Jetson Nano. You'll learn how to:
Set up your Jetson Nano Developer Kit and camera to run this course
Collect varied data for image classification projects
Train neural network models for classification
Annotate image data for regression
Train neural network models for regression to localize features
Run inference on a live camera feed with your trained models
When used for swap, zram (like zswap) allows Linux to make more efficient use of RAM, since the operating system can then hold more pages of memory in the compressed swap than if the same amount of RAM had been used as application memory or disk cache.

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the introduction of my Jetson Nano Boot Camp course. Nowadays, image processing, computer vision and Python programming language are becoming very popular. In order to realize our own machine learning projects, we will carry out a machine learning project with Jetson Nano which is a powerful artificial intelligence computer. Not limited to this, we will learn about Python, Image Processing and machine learning.

Of course, we will start with Python and learn the basics of Python well.We will learn about the concept of variables, standard input and output functions, loops, conditional structures, functions, modules and more.

And then we will get into the topic of image processing. We will learn the basics of the OpenCV library, which has been developed for a long time, and detect the objects we want in real time with the software using the machine learning method.

Of course, in addition to detecting objects, we will also be able to control the Arduino board, which is very popular in the world, according to the object we have detected.

Thanks to the school crossing sign project included in the course, we will detect our school crossing sign together with our Jetson Nano board and then reduce its speed according to the school crossing sign where we detect our DC motor that we connect to our Arduino board.

Since the course was created as a result of years of academic and technical experience, you will be able to carry out your own machine learning projects together with Jetson Nano when you finish the course.
